```{r}
# Question 3
# Add a new column to extract the genus from the scientific name
filter_data <- filter_data %>%
# Extract the genus by taking the first word of the scientific name
  mutate(Genus = sub(" .*", "", ScientificName))

# Calculate the average crown diameter for each genus

  group_by(Genus) %>%   # Group data by genus
  summarize(Avg_Crown_Diameter = mean(as.numeric(AvgCdia..m.), na.rm = TRUE))  # Calculate mean crown diameter, ignoring missing values
  

# Identify the genus with the largest average crown diameter
largest_crown <- average_crown %>%
  filter(Avg_Crown_Diameter == max(Avg_Crown_Diameter, na.rm = TRUE))

# Print result
print(largest_crown)

```{r}
# Extra Credit Tree Age

# Calculate average age and crown diameter by genus
average_crown <- filter_data %>%
  group_by(Genus) %>%
  summarize(
    average_age = mean(as.numeric(Age), na.rm = TRUE),
    Avg_Crown_Diameter = mean(as.numeric(AvgCdia..m.), na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(Avg_Crown_Diameter))

# Display the table 
print(average_crown)

# The table shows differencesin the average age of the different genera of trees in the dataset. Age explains the differences in crown diameter, but itâ€™s not the only factor. For example, Carya has an average age (28.97 years) similar to Platanus, but its crown diameter (10.50 m) is significantly smaller meaning that other factors such as species growth rate influence crown diameter
